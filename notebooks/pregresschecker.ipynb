Approximately 150 sites globallywill\\nparticipate in this study.\\nParticipants will be adults ≥ 18 years of age who are healthy or have medically-stable chronic\\ndiseases, and are at increased risk for SARS-CoV-2 acquisition and COVID-19.\\nApproximately 30 000 participants will be randomized in a 2:1 ratio to receive 2 IM doses of\\neither 5 × 1010vp (nominal, ± 1.5 × 1010 vp) AZD1222 (n= approximately 20 000) or saline\\nplacebo (n= approximately 10 000) 4 weeks apart, on Days 1 and 29. Randomization will be\\nstratified by age (≥ 18 to < 65 years, and ≥ 65 years), with at least 25% of participants to be\\nenrolled in the older age stratum. Participants who received their first dose of study\\nintervention between 28 August 2020 and 06 September 2020 will receive their second dose\\nof study intervention outside of the study window.\\n\\n\\nAll participants will be assessed for efficacy and safety. The first participants randomized in\\neach age groupin the USA, including 1 500 participants 18 to 55years of age,\\n750 participants 56 to 69 years of age, and 750 participants ≥ 70 years of age, will also\\nparticipate in a substudy assessing the reactogenicity and immunogenicity of AZD1222.\\nTo further investigate cell-mediated immunogenicity, in particular Th1/Th2 responses, after\\nAZD1222 or saline placebo administration, an immunogenicity cohort of approximately\\n300 participants was added.\\nAPSRT will provide support for blinded safety surveillance during the study. Additionally, an\\nindependent COVID-19 Vaccine DSMB organized by the National Institutes of Health,\\nNational Institute for Allergy and Infectious Diseases, will provide oversight, to ensure safe\\nand ethical conduct of the study. An independent Neurological AESI Expert Committee will\\nbe available to review and provide advice to the PSRT and the COVID-19 Vaccine DSMB on\\nrequest about the diagnosis and causality assessment of selected neurological AESIs.\\nParticipants will remain on study for 2 years following administration of the first dose of study\\nintervention (Day 730). If AZD1222 is proven to be safe and efficacious based on the primary\\nendpoint analysis, following discussion at that time with the US FDA, other Regulators if\\nappropriate, and the COVID-19 Vaccine DSMB, participants allocated to the saline placebo\\ngroup will be offered AZD1222 when doses are available. Saline placebo participants treated\\nwith AZD1222 will continue to be followed in the study.\\nDisclosure Statement: This is a parallel-group preventive study with 2 arms that is\\nparticipant-, investigator-, and Sponsor-blinded.\\nNumber of Participants: Approximately 33 000 participants will be screened to achieve up\\nto approximately 30 000 participants randomly assigned to study intervention, including\\napproximately 20 000 participants randomized to the AZD1222 arm and approximately\\n10 000 participants randomized to the saline placebo arm.\\nNote: ‘Enrolled’ means a participant's, or their legally acceptable representative’s, agreement\\nto participate in a clinical study following completion of the informed consent process.\\nPotential participants who are screened for the purpose of determining eligibility for the study,\\nbut are not randomly assigned in the study, are considered ‘screen failures’.\\nIntervention Groups and Duration: Participants will be randomized in a 2:1 ratio to receive\\n2 IM doses of 5 × 1010 vp (nominal, ± 1.5 × 1010 vp) AZD1222 or saline placebo. Study\\nintervention will be administered on Days 1 and 29.\\nData Monitoring Committee: Yes\\n\\n\\nStatistical Methods\\nPrimary efficacy endpoint\\nThe primary efficacy endpoint is a binary response, whereby a participant with negative\\nserostatus at baseline is defined as a COVID-19 case if their first case of SARS-CoV-2\\nRT-PCR-positive symptomatic illness occurs ≥ 15days post second dose of study\\nintervention. Otherwise, a participant is not defined as a COVID-19 case.\\nSample size\\nApproximately 33 000 participants will be screened such that approximately\\n30 000 participants will be randomized in a 2:1 ratio to receive 2 IM dosesof either\\n5 × 1010vp (nominal, ± 1.5 × 1010vp) AZD1222 (the active group, n = approximately 20 000)\\nor saline placebo (the control group, n = approximately 10 000) 4 weeks apart, on Days 1 and\\n29.\\nThe sample size calculations are based on the primary efficacy endpoint and were derived\\nfollowing a modified Poissonregression approach (Zou 2004). The calculations account for an\\ninterim and primary analysis, and the timing of these analyses will be driven by the number of\\nevents observed in the study. The interim analysis will be carried out when approximately\\n50% of the total amount of statistical information is available. A Lan-DeMets alpha-spending\\nfunction has been used to control the overall type I error at 5% with 0.31% alpha at the interim\\nanalysis and 4.9% at the primaryanalysis. The calculations assume minimal loss to follow-up\\nas it is anticipated that participants will remain engaged in the study. All participants will be\\nfollowed for the entire duration of the study.\\nFor the primary efficacy analysis, approximately 150 events meeting the primary efficacy\\nendpoint definition within the population of participants who are seronegative at baseline are\\nrequired across the active and control groups to detect a VE of 60% with > 90% power. These\\ncalculations assume an observed attack rate of approximately 0.8% and are based ona 2-sided\\ntest, where the lower bound of the 2-sided 95.10% CI for VE is required to be greater than\\n30% withan observed point estimate of at least 50%.\\nAn interim efficacy analysis will be conducted when approximately 75 events meeting the\\nprimary endpoint definition have been reported across the active and control groups within the\\npopulation of participants who are seronegative at baseline, which will give > 70% power to\\ndetect a VE of 70% and > 90% power to detect a VE of 75%. These calculations assume an\\nobserved attack rate of approximately 0.4% and are based on a 2-sided test, where the lower\\nbound of the 2-sided 99.69% CI for VE is required to be greater than 30% with an observed\\npoint estimate of at least 50%. A statistically significant finding at the interim analysis will not\\nbe considered a reason to stop the study, but instead will be interpreted as early assessment of\\nefficacy.\\n\\n\\nPrimary estimand\\nThe primary estimand will be used for the analysis of the primary efficacy endpoint. It will be\\nbased on participants in the fully vaccinated analysis set, defined as all randomized\\nparticipants who are seronegative at baseline, receive 2 doses of study intervention, and who\\nremain on-study 15 days after their second dose without having had a prior SARS-CoV-2\\nRT-PCR-positive confirmed COVID-19 infection, analyzed according to their randomized\\ntreatment. For participants with multiple events, only the first occurrence will be used for the\\nprimary efficacy endpoint analysis. The set of intercurrent events for this estimand consists of\\nparticipants who withdraw from the study or are unblinded to treatment assignment prior to\\nhaving met the primary efficacy endpoint. The intercurrent event of early study withdrawal\\nwill be handled using the treatment policy strategy and the absence of data following these\\nparticipants’ withdrawal will be treated as missing (ie, counted as not having met the criteria).\\nParticipants unblinded to treatment assignment prior to having met the criteria for the primary\\nefficacy endpoint will be censored at the date of unblinding. Participants who withdraw before\\n15 days post second dose or who have a case prior to 15 days post second dose will be\\nexcluded from primary endpoint analysis.\\nPrimary efficacy analysis\\nAs the primary efficacy analysis, the plan is to use the primary estimand and a Poisson\\nregression model with robust variance (Zou 2004)to analyze the primary efficacy endpoint,\\nincluding study arm and age as covariates as well as the log of the follow-up time as an offset.\\nThe VE will be estimated from the model, which will give the RRR in the incidence of\\nSARS-CoV-2 RT-PCR-positive symptomatic illness. VE is calculated as\\nRRR = 100*(1-relative risk), which is the incidence in the vaccine group relative to the\\nincidence in the control group expressed as a percentage. At the interim analysis, the VE will\\nbe presented with a 2-sided 99.69% CI, and statistical significance will be achieved if the 2-\\nsided 99.69% CI is > 30%. The success criterion for the interim analysis will be statistical\\nsignificance with an observed VE point estimate of at least 50%. At the primary analysis, VE\\nwill be presented with a 2-sided 95.10% CI, and statistical significance will be achieved if the\\n2-sided 95.10% CI is > 30%. The success criterion for the primary analysis of the study will\\nbe statistical significance with an observed VE point estimate of at least 50%.\\nModel assumptions will be checked and the robustness of the primary analysis will be\\nassessed. The Poisson regression model with robust variance has the flexibility for exploring\\nmultiple imputation approaches using, eg, the observed placebo attack rate to impute missing\\ndata. If the Poisson regression model with robust variance fails to converge, an alternative\\napproach will be implemented. Full details will be documented in the SAP.\",\n",

       " 'INTRODUCTION: Study Rationale': '2.1     Study Rationale\\nThe aim of the study is to assess the safety, efficacy, and immunogenicity of AZD1222 for\\nprevention of COVID-19. The COVID-19 pandemic has caused major disruption to healthcare\\nsystems with significant socioeconomic impacts. Currently, there are no licensed preventions\\navailable against COVID-19 and accelerated vaccine development is urgently needed. A safe\\nand effective vaccine for COVID-19 prevention would have significant global public health\\nimpact.',\n",
       " 'INTRODUCTION: Background': '2.2     Background\\nIn December 2019, a cluster of patients with pneumonia of unknown cause was linked to a\\nseafood wholesale market in Wuhan, China and were later confirmed to be infected with a\\nnovel coronavirus, known as 2019-nCoV (Zhu et al 2020). The virus was subsequently\\nrenamed to SARS-CoV-2 because it is similar to the coronavirus responsible for SARS-CoV,\\na lineage B Betacoronavirus. SARS-CoV-2 shares more than 79% of its sequence with\\nSARS-CoV, and 50% with the coronavirus responsible for MERS-CoV, a member of the\\nlineage C Betacoronavirus (Lu et al 2020). COVID-19 is the infectious disease caused by\\nSARS-CoV-2. By January 2020 there was increasing evidence of human-to-human\\ntransmission as the number of cases rapidly began to increase in China. Spread of the virus\\nhas been rapid and now encompasses the globe. The WHO declared the novel coronavirus a\\npandemic on 11 March 2020. As of 18 October 2020, there have been more than 40 million\\nconfirmed cases and > 1.1 milliondeaths globally (WHO 2020). It is believed that evolution\\nof the pandemic will vary across countries, affected in part by different containment strategies\\nranging from extreme lockdownto relative inaction. As a result, there may be regional waves\\nof the disease and pockets of vulnerable populations. Globally, governments have\\nacknowledged that an effective vaccine against COVID-19 is the onlyway to guarantee a safe\\nand sustained exit strategy from repeated lockdowns.\\nCoVs are spherical, enveloped viruses withpositive-sense single-stranded RNA genomes.\\nOne fourth of their genome is responsible for coding structural proteins, such as the\\nS glycoprotein, envelope, membrane, and nucleocapsid proteins. Envelope, membrane, and\\nnucleocapsid proteinsare mainly responsible for virion assembly whilst the S protein is\\ninvolved in receptor binding, mediating virus entry into host cells during CoVs infection via\\ndifferent receptors (Li 2016). SARS-CoV-2 belongs to the phylogenetic lineage B of the\\ngenus Betacoronavirusand it recognizes the ACE2 as the entry receptor (Zhou et al 2020). It\\n\\n\\nis the seventh CoV known to cause human infections and the third known to cause severe\\ndisease after SARS-CoV and MERS-CoV.\\nAZD1222 is a recombinant replication-defective chimpanzee adenovirus expressing the\\nSARS-CoV-2 S surface glycoprotein. Development of AZD1222, previously referred to as\\nChAdOx1 nCoV-19, was initiated by the University of Oxford with subsequent transfer of\\ndevelopment activities to the Sponsor. Nonclinical studies found AZD1222 to be\\nimmunogenic in BALB/c and CD-1 mice, ferret, porcine, and NHP models. Whilst a single\\ndose of AZD1222 induced antigen-specific antibody and T-cell responses, a booster\\nimmunization enhanced antibody responses, particularly in pigs, with significant increases in\\nSARS-CoV-2 neutralising antibody titres (Graham et al 2020). Further, in a SARS-CoV-2\\nchallenge NHP model, a single administration of AZD1222 significantly reduced viral load in\\nbronchoalveolar lavage fluid and respiratory tract tissue of vaccinated rhesus macaques as\\ncompared to vector controls. Importantly, no evidence of VAERD following SARS-CoV-2\\nchallenge in vaccinated rhesus macaques was observed (van Doremalen et al 2020).\\nThe clinical development program for AZD1222 was initiated by the University of Oxford,\\nand currently has 4 ongoing studies being conducted in the UK (FIH COV001\\n[NCT04324606], COV002 [NCT04400838]), Brazil (COV003 [ISRCTN89951424], and\\nSouth Africa (COV005 [NCT04444674]). The Sponsor, in addition to this study, has\\n2ongoing studies in Russia (D8111C00001 [NCT04540393]) and Japan (D8111C00002).\\nPreliminary unblinded data are available for the FIH Study COV001 and Study COV002.\\nStudyCOV001 enrolled the first participant on 23April 2020 and completed enrollment on\\n21 May 2020 with 1 077 participants. Preliminary data as of 24 July 2020 from\\n544 participants who received at least one dose of 5 × 1010 vp AZD1222 and 10 participants\\nwho received a second dose of 5 × 1010 vp AZD1222 4 weeks later found the vaccine was\\ngenerally tolerated, with no treatment-related SAEs reported through 28 days post dose. The\\nmost common local solicited AEs were vaccination site pain and tenderness. The most\\ncommon systemic solicited AEs were chills, feverishness, fever, headache, malaise, and\\nmyalgia. The majority of events were mild or moderate in severity and resolved within 1 to\\n7 days. Following the second dose, a general attenuation in the incidence and severity of local\\nand systemic solicited AEs was observed.\\nPreliminary immunogenicity data from Study COV001 suggest that a single dose can elicit\\nboth humoral and cellular immunogenicity responses and that antibody responses are boosted\\nafter a second dose. S-specific T-cell responses peaked on Day 14. Anti-S IgG responses rose\\nby Day 28, and were boosted 3-fold following a second dose.\\nNeutralizing antibody responses against SARS-CoV-2 were detected in 32 (91%) of\\n35 participants after a single dose when measured in microneutralization assay (MNA ) and\\n                                                         80\\nin 35 (100%) participants when measured in plaque reduction neutralization test (PRNT ).\\n                                                          50\\n\\n\\nAfter the second dose, all participants had neutralizing activity (9 of 9 in MNA at Day 42\\n                                                    80\\nand 10 of 10 in Marburg virus neutralization assay on Day 56). Neutralizing antibody\\nresponses correlated strongly with antibody levels measured by ELISA (Folegatti et al 2020b).\\nAs of 01 October 2020, Study COV002 enrolled 10 013 participants, including\\n5 152 participants who received at least one dose of AZD1222 ranging from 2.2 × 1010 vp to\\n5 × 1010vp. Based on preliminary data as of 24 July 2020, the local and systemic solicited-AE\\nprofile following a single dose of 5 × 1010 vp in participants 18 to 55 years of age was\\ngenerally comparable to results in StudyCOV001. In general, a decline in the incidence and\\nseverity of solicited AEs was observed across the age groups (18-55, 56-69, and ≥ 70 years).\\nAnother ChAdOx1-vectored vaccine expressing the full-length S protein from a related\\nbetacoronavirus, MERS-CoV, has been given to 53 participants as part of 2 ongoing\\ndose-escalation Phase I studies (MERS001 [NCT03399578] and MERS002 [NCT04170829],\\nsponsored by the University of Oxford) at doses ranging from 5 × 109vp to 5 ×1010 vp.\\nPreliminary immunogenicity data from MERS001 suggested that a single dose of ChAdOx1\\nMERS can elicit both humoral and cellular responses. Overall, the vaccine was safe and\\ngenerally well tolerated, with no serious adverse reactions reported in either study.\\nThe ChAdOx1 platform has been used in 14 clinical studies sponsored by the University of\\nOxford with immunogens from multiple pathogens such as influenza, tuberculosis, malaria,\\nchikungunya, Zika, MERS-CoV, and Meningitis B. Over 360 healthy adult participants have\\nreceived ChAdOx1-vectored vaccines in these studies. These vaccines demonstrated robust\\nimmunogenicity after a single dose and favorable safety profiles, with no vaccine-related\\nSAEs.\\nSee the AZD1222 IB, Sections 4 and 5 for additional information on nonclinical and clinical\\nstudies, respectively, of AZD1222 and related ChAdOx1-vectored vaccines. Detail on the\\ndevelopment and chemistry of AZD1222 is provided in the IB, Section 3.\\nOverall, the preliminary data from the AZD1222 clinical and nonclinical studies, and the\\nacceptable safety and efficacy data for the MERS-CoV vaccine and other ChAdOx1-vectored\\nvaccines, support further development of AZD1222 for the prevention of COVID-19.\\n2.3     Benefit/Risk Assessment\\nMore detailed information about the known and expected benefits and potential risks of\\nAZD1222 can be found in the AZD1222 IB.',\n",

       " 'STUDY  DESIGN: Scientific Rationale for Study Design: Rationale for Study Design and Participant Population': '4.2.1   Rationale for Study Design and Participant Population\\nThe participant population is male and female adults ≥ 18 years of age who are not\\nimmunosuppressed, but are at increased risk of SARS-Cov-2 infection due to their locations\\nor circumstances. Inclusion of older adults is based on data that are being gathered from the\\nongoing Universityof Oxford-sponsored studies. Study COV001 (NCT04324606) enrolled\\nadults 18 to 55years of age. Study COV002 (NCT04400838) enrolled adults 18 years of age\\nand older.\\nAdults with medically-stable chronic diseases may participate if, according to the judgement\\nof the investigator, hospitalization within the study period is not anticipated and the\\nparticipant appears likely to be able to remain on study through the end ofprotocol-specified\\nfollow-up.\\nThe study will exclude females who are pregnant or breast-feeding and individuals less than\\n18 years of age. Women who are pregnant or breast-feeding are excluded at this point as\\nnonclinical developmental and reproductive toxicity studies to support vaccinating these\\nindividuals have yet to be performed. Additionally, it is planned that children and adolescents\\n\\n\\nwill be evaluated for their response to the vaccine once safety and efficacy have been\\nestablished in adults.\\nParticipants who have been previously diagnosed with laboratory-confirmed SARS-CoV-2\\ninfection are excluded from study participation. Participants with previous asymptomatic or\\nundiagnosed infection are not excluded.

Safety and immunogenicity data from an additional clinical study, MERS001\\n(NCT03399578), using the same ChAdOx1 vector, also helped inform dose selection.\\n\\n\\nMERS001 was the first clinical study of a ChAdOx1-vectored vaccine expressing the\\nfull-length S protein from a separate, but related, betacoronavirus. ChAdOx1 MERS has been\\ngiven to 31 participants to date at doses ranging from 5 × 109 vp to 5 × 1010 vp. Despite higher\\nreactogenicity observed at the 5 × 1010 vp, this dose was safe, with self-limiting AEs and no\\nserious adverse reactions recorded. The 5 × 1010 vp was the most immunogenic, in terms of\\ninducing neutralizing antibodies against MERS-CoV using a live virus assay (Folegatti et al\\n2020a). Given the immunogenicity findings and safety profile observed with the\\nChAdOx1-vectored vaccine against MERS-CoV, the 5 × 1010 vp dose was chosen for\\nAZD1222. See the AZD1222 IB.\\nBased on accumulating nonclinical and clinical data gathered for AZD1222 as well as for\\nother SARS-CoV-2 vaccines in development, a 2-dose regimen was selected for the study in\\norder to enhance the immune responses to the virus (AZD1222 IB).\\nIn an NHP challenge study, 6 macaques received a second dose of AZD1222 4 weeks after the\\nfirst dose. The second dose resulted in increases in both ELISA and neutralizing antibody\\ntiters, and fewer areas of the lung contained viral RNA in prime boost group compared to the\\nprime group. In a porcine model, 3 pigs also received a second dose of AZD1222 4 weeks\\nafter the first dose. In the animalsthat received the booster dose, both antibodies to the\\nSARS-CoV-2 RBD and neutralizing antibodies were boosted after the second dose.\\nIn Study COV001, 10 participants received a second dose of AZD1222 4 weeks after the first\\ndose. Antibody responses to both the first and second doses were evaluated using an ELISA\\nassay, through the MSD platform and by both neutralizationand pseudo-neutralizationassays.\\nNotable increases in antibody levels to the S protein were seen with the ELISA assay and\\nincreases to both the S protein and RBD were noted using the MSD platform. Similarly,\\nincreases in antibody levels following the second dose were also seen with neutralization and\\npseudo-neutralization assays. Though based on small numbers, the second dose of the vaccine\\nappeared to result in a lower rate of systemic solicited AEs.\\nThe 4-week interval was selected based on the interval used in the nonclinical studies and\\nStudy COV001.',\n",

An AE can therefore be any unfavorable and unintended sign\\n(eg, an abnormal laboratory finding), symptom (for example nausea, chest pain), or disease\\ntemporally associated with the use of a medicinal product, whether or not considered related\\nto the medicinal product.\\nThe term AE is used to include both SAEs and non-SAEs and can include a deterioration of a\\npre-existing medical occurrence. An AE may occur at any time, including run-in or washout\\nperiods, even if no study intervention has been administered.\\nB 2     Definition of Serious Adverse Events\\nAn SAE is an AE occurring during any study phase (ie, run-in, treatment, washout,\\nfollow-up), that fulfils one or more of the following criteria:\\n\\uf0b7  Results in death\\n\\uf0b7  Is immediately life-threatening\\n\\uf0b7  Requires in-participant hospitalization or prolongation of existing hospitalization\\n\\uf0b7  Results in persistent or significant disability or incapacity\\n\\uf0b7  Is a congenital abnormality or birth defect\\n\\uf0b7  Is an important medical event that may jeopardize the participant or may require medical\\n   treatment to prevent one of the outcomes listed above.\\nAEs for malignant tumors reported during a study should generally be assessed as SAEs. If\\nno other seriousness criteria apply, the ‘Important Medical Event’ criterion should be used. In\\ncertain situations, however, medical judgement on an individual event basis should be applied\\nto clarify that the malignant tumor event should be assessed and reported as a non-SAE. For\\nexample, if the tumor is included as medical history and progression occurs during the study,\\nbut the progression does not change treatment and/or prognosis of the malignant tumor, the\\nAE may not fulfil the attributes for being assessed as serious, although reporting of the\\nprogression of the malignant tumor as an AE is valid and should occur. Also, some types of\\nmalignant tumors, which do not spread remotely after a routine treatment that does not require\\nhospitalization, may be assessed as non-serious; examples in adults include Stage 1 basal cell\\ncarcinoma and Stage 1A1 cervical cancer removed via cone biopsy.\\n\\n\\nLife Threatening\\n‘Life-threatening’ means that the participant was at immediate risk of death from the AE as it\\noccurred or it is suspected that use or continued use of the study intervention would result in\\nthe participant’s death. ‘Life-threatening’ does not mean that had an AE occurred in a more\\nsevere form it might have caused death (eg, hepatitis that resolved without hepatic failure).\\nHospitalization\\nOutpatient treatment in an emergency room is not in itself an SAE, although the reasons for it\\nmay be (eg, bronchospasm, laryngeal oedema). Hospital admissions and/or surgical operations\\nplanned before or during a study are not considered AEs if the illness or disease existed before\\nthe participant was enrolled in the study, provided that it did not deteriorate in an unexpected\\nway during the study.\\nImportant Medical Event or Medical Treatment\\nMedical and scientific judgement should be exercised in deciding whether a case is serious in\\nsituations where important medical events may not be immediately life threatening or result in\\ndeath, hospitalization, disability, or incapacity but may jeopardize the participant or may\\nrequire medical treatment to prevent one or more outcomes listed in the definition of serious.\\nThese should usually be considered as serious.\\nSimply stopping the suspect drug does not mean that it is an important medical event; medical\\njudgement must be used.\\nExamples of important medical events include such events as listed below:\\n\\uf0b7  Angioedema not severe enough to require intubation but requiring iv hydrocortisone\\n   treatment\\n\\uf0b7  Hepatotoxicity caused by acetaminophen overdose requiring treatment with\\n   N-acetylcysteine\\n\\uf0b7  Intensive treatment in an emergency room or at home for allergic bronchospasm\\n\\uf0b7  Blood dyscrasias (eg, neutropenia or anaemia requiring blood transfusion, etc.) or\\n   convulsions that do not result in hospitalisation\\n\\uf0b7  Development of drug dependency or drug abuse\\nIntensity Rating Scale\\nThe grading scales found in the US FDA guidance for healthy volunteers enrolled in a\\npreventive vaccine clinical study (FDA 2007) will be utilized for all events with an assigned\\nseverity grading.\\nIt is important to distinguish between serious and severe AEs. Severity is a measure of\\nintensity whereas seriousness is defined by the criteria in Appendix B 2. An AE of severe\\n\\n\\nintensity need not necessarily be considered serious. For example, nausea that persists for\\nseveral hours may be considered severe nausea, but not anSAE unless it meets the criteria\\nshown in Appendix B 2. On the other hand, a stroke that results in only a limited degree of\\ndisability may be considered a mild stroke but would be anSAE when it satisfies the criteria\\nshown in Appendix B 2.\\nB 3     A Guide to Interpreting the Causality Question\\nWhen making an assessment of causality consider the following factors when deciding if there\\nis a ‘reasonable possibility’that an AE may have been caused by the IMP.\\n\\uf0b7  Time Course. Exposure to suspect drug. Has the participant actually received the suspect\\n   drug? Did the AE occur in a reasonable temporal relationship to the administration of the\\n   suspect IMP?\\n\\uf0b7  Consistency with known IMP profile. Was the AE consistent withthe previous\\n   knowledge of the suspect IMP(pharmacology and toxicology) or drugs of the same\\n   pharmacological class? Or could the AE be anticipated from its pharmacological\\n   properties?\\n\\uf0b7  De-challenge experience. Did the AE resolve or improve on stopping or reducing the dose\\n   of the suspect IMP?\\n\\uf0b7  No alternative cause. The AE cannot be reasonably explained by another aetiology such\\n   as the underlying disease, other drugs, other host or environmental factors.\\n\\uf0b7  Re-challenge experience. Did the AE reoccur if the suspected IMP was reintroduced after\\n   having been stopped? AstraZeneca would not normally recommend or support a\\n   re-challenge.\\n\\uf0b7  Laboratory tests. A specific laboratory investigation (if performed) has confirmed the\\n   relationship.\\nIn difficult cases, other factors could be considered such as:\\n\\uf0b7  Is this a recognized feature of overdose of the IMP?\\n\\uf0b7  Is there a known mechanism?\\nCausality of ‘related’ is made if following a review of the relevant data, there is evidence for a\\n‘reasonable possibility’of a causal relationship for the individual case. The expression\\n‘reasonable possibility’ of a causal relationship is meant to convey, in general, that there are\\nfacts (evidence) or argumentsto suggest a causal relationship.\\nThe causality assessment is performed based on the available data including enough\\ninformation to make an informed judgment. With no available facts or arguments to suggest a\\ncausal relationship, the event(s) will be assessed as ‘not related’.\\n\\n\\nCausal relationship in cases where the disease under study has deteriorated due to lack of\\neffect should be classified as no reasonable possibility.\\nB 4     Medication Error\\nFor the purposes of this clinical study a medication error is an unintended failure or mistake in\\nthe treatment process for an AstraZeneca study intervention that either causes harm to the\\nparticipant or has the potential to cause harm to the participant.\\nA medication error is not lack of efficacy of the IMP, but rather a human or process related\\nfailure while the IMP is in control of the study site staff or participant.\\nMedication error includes situations where an error.\\n\\uf0b7  Occurred\\n\\uf0b7  Was identified and intercepted before the participant received the IMP\\n\\uf0b7  Did not occur, but circumstances were recognised that could have led to an error\\nExamples of events to be reported in clinical studies as medication errors:\\n\\uf0b7  IMP name confusion\\n\\uf0b7  Dispensing error eg, medication prepared incorrectly, even if it was not actually given to\\n   the participant\\n\\uf0b7  IMP not administered as indicated, for example, wrong route or wrong site of\\n   administration\\n\\uf0b7  IMP not taken as indicated eg, tablet dissolved in water when it should be taken as a solid\\n   tablet\\n\\uf0b7  IMP not stored as instructed eg, kept in the fridge when it should be at room temperature\\n\\uf0b7  Wrong participant received the medication (excluding IRT errors)\\n\\uf0b7  Wrong IMP administered to participant (excluding IRT errors)\\nExamples of events that do notrequire reporting as medication errors in clinical studies:\\n\\uf0b7  Errors related to or resulting from IRT - including those which lead to one of the above\\n   listed events that would otherwise have been a medication error\\n\\uf0b7  Participant accidentally missed IMP dose(s) eg, forgot to take medication\\n\\uf0b7  Accidental overdose (will be captured as an overdose)\\n\\uf0b7  Errors related to background and rescue medication, or standard of care medication in\\n   open label studies, even if an AstraZeneca product\\nMedication errors are not regarded as AEs but AEs may occur as a consequence of the\\nmedication error.\\n\\n\\nAppendix C  Handling of Human Biological Samples\\nC 1     Chain of Custody\\nA full chain of custody is maintained for all samples throughout their lifecycle.\\nThe investigator at each study site keeps full traceability of collected biological samples from\\nthe participants while in storage at the study site until shipment or disposal (where\\nappropriate) and records relevant processing information related to the samples whilst at site.\\nThe sample receiver keeps full traceability of the samples while in storage and during use until\\nused or disposed of or until further shipment and keeps record of receipt of arrival and onward\\nshipment or disposal.\\nThe Sponsor or delegated representatives will keep oversight of the entire life cycle through\\ninternal procedures, monitoring of study sites, auditing or process checks, and contractual\\nrequirements of external laboratory providers\\nSamples retained for further use will be stored in the AstraZeneca-assigned biobanks or other\\nsample archive facilities and will be tracked by the appropriate AstraZeneca Team during for\\nthe remainder of the sample life cycle.\\nC 2     Withdrawal of Informed Consent for Donated Biological Samples\\nThe Sponsor ensures that biological samples are destroyed at the end of a specified period as\\ndescribed in the informed consent.\\nIf a participant withdraws consent to the use of donated biological samples, the samples will\\nbe disposed of/destroyed/repatriated, and the action documented.
